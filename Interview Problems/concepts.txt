1. difference between Obj Constructor & Obj Create.
ans: 
# in obj constructor, if there is a function inside the constructor, then it will be showed in the output, if we call the object.
but, in Obj Creator, if we don't call the function explicitly, then it will now shown by default.
# Obj Constructor shows the name of the Obj in the output. but in Create method, it only shows the objects (key, value) pair, not the object name.

2. What is the difference between Call, Apply & Bind?
ans: this two method works same. but in call method, we have to pass the arguments separated by comma. but in apply method we have to use the array.
In bind method, we have to use another variable for the arguments or to pass the arguments. this variable works like a function. We have to call the variable later.
